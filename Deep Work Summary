<body> <font> <h1> Deep Work Summary Part - 2 </h1> </font> <br>

<font> <h2> How to know if a work task is deep</h2>
- Imagine a child who knows nothing, then think how long it will take you to teach him/her to do the task. If it would take less time,<br>
it is a shallow work task. If would take a more time, it is a deep work task. Example -  It would take less time to teach the child to <br>
respond to messages than to teach it to analyse <br>
customer requests and upgrade the product. <br>
<br>
<h2> Chapter - 1 Work Deeply </h2> <br>
<br>
1. Create work rituals. Ex- Meditate for 3 minutes before working.<br>
2. Create work goals. Ex- I will finish ‘x’ chapters in ‘x’ time.<br>
3. You can make grand gestures, but do it sparingly if you can at all. Ex- Book an expensive hotel room to make sure you finish the work.<br>
4. Have few extremely important goals you want to accomplish<br>
5. Keep a habit tracker or a score card to track your time of working deep. Keep it above the desk you work at. <br>
6. Review your work regularly to see what limits your work and what improves it.<br>
7. Take regular breaks from deep work to replenish your ‘brain points’. This will improve your quality of deep work. Rests include -<br>
- Cold exposure<br>
- Hot exposures (Sauna/Steam room)<br>
- Massages<br>
- Sleep<br>
- Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)<br>
8. Don’t replace your rests from deep work with shallow work, schedule it instead. <br>
<br>
<h2> Chapter - 2 Embrace Boredom </h2><br>
<br>
1. When working, just work and when resting just rest. Don’t keep switching between the two.<br>
2. You can use President Roosevelt’s productivity tactic. In this technique you plan the work you need to complete and set a deadline on a timer. <br>
Plan the work in such a way that even a 30 second break is going to stop you from finishing the task, then you’re going to work continuously. <br>
3. Do productive meditation. In this meditation you’re going to think of a particular problem in your career or business and try to solve it without<br>
getting distracted. Some tips are -<br>
- Be wary of distractions and looping (when you keep thinking about the thing you just solved. )<br>
- Structure your deep meditation sessions<br>
4. You can memorise a deck of cards. This will increase your ability of attention control. To do this you have to picture 10 things in a room and <br>
five rooms and 2 things outside your house. Then picture 52 famous people for each card of the deck. Lastly you have to link each person with the <br>
location in your house.<br>

<h2> Chapter - 3  Quit Social Media </h2><br>
<br>
1. If there is any benefit don’t immediately rush out to do it, instead weigh out the pros and the cons before deploying the strategies.<br>
2. When choosing tools, always make sure that they align with the core factors that determine success and happiness and also that the negatives are<br>
outweighed by the positives.<br>
3. Identify some high level goals like: “To craft well-written, narrative-driven stories that change the  way people understand the world.” Then<br>
write out the key activities that support your goals. Now check to see whether the internet tools are helping you reach this goal.<br>
4. Follow to 80-20 rule. This is rule explains that 20% of the work yields 80% of the results. Always do the 20% work tasks and once that’s finished<br>
identify the new 20% activities and do that. Avoid doing the 80% activities.<br>
5. Quit social media. Stop using all social media for a month. When you feel you NEED to use an app for a 20% activity, only then use it. Stop using <br>
the application you didn’t use for the 30 days.<br>
6. Schedule your time. If you schedule your time and replace low quality entertainment like YouTube shorts and instead replace it with things like <br>
reading books and listening to audio books and podcasts it will improve both: Your meaning and purpose and improve your ability to work deeply.<br>
<br>
<h2> Chapter - 4 Drain the shallows </h2><br>
<br>
1. Schedule every minute of your day. Do this the day before. If a new insight takes you by surprise spend time it and then schedule the remaining time.<br>
If something happens and you can’t stick to your schedule, then do the task and edit your schedule.<br>
2. Keep a budget for shallow work. First quantify the amount of time you spend on shallow and deep work tasks, then decide which percentage of your time<br>
you’ll spend on the shallows. 30%-40% is a good range to consider. If your job doesn’t require much deep work, it’s a good indicator to switch your job <br>
as you’re not providing much value.<br>
3. Keep a fixed time each day after which you will not work past. This will help you get the rest that is very much required for deep work and also force<br>
you to limit the amount of shallow work you can do.<br>
<br>
5. Become hard to reach<br>
<br>
i. Make the person sending the emails or DMs work harder. Whenever giving access to your email to large amount of people, put a note next to it saying that<br>
only emails relevant to a particular topic must be sent and that you will respond to only these emails. Or make them see a QaA or make them pay a small amount<br>
to make them sure that their doubt is important<br>

ii. Put mare effort when sending and receiving Emails/messages. Make your messages extremely informative and valuable. It should be done in such a way that<br>
it takes the bare minimum number of messages need to be sent/received to finish a project. Ex - How was the project meeting ? Let’s talk about the project <br>
while grabbing a cup of coffee. Answer - The reply must have specific date and time regarding the coffee and a way to find a way to fix the time if the ones<br>
you put were not suitable. <br>
<br>
iii. You have the ability to not respond to Emails<br>
To find if the emails are worth responding -<br>
a. It doesn’t interest you<br>
b. It has (0) zero effect on your life.<br>
c. It’s not clear how your [x] is need. <br>
There are exceptions, reply how you see fit.<br>
